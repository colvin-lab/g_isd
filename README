g_isd
=====

Molecular dynamics analysis tools based on inter-structure distance.

Expected software packages:
gcc
g++
gromacs-4.5 or newer (older versions may work but haven't been tested)
xmgrace (to view xvg figures)


You will need to set the GMXINC and GMXLIB variables in the makefile.
By default, gromacs puts these directories at:
/usr/local/gromacs/include
/usr/local/gromacs/lib

For the Ubuntu gromacs package, these can both be set to:
/usr/include/gromacs

You may need to set the GMXLIB environment variable to the
location of the standard GROMACS topology files. This is
/usr/local/gromacs/share/gromacs/top by default, but will vary
between installations.
